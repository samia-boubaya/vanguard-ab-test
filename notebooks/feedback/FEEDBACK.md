# Feedback

- Don't add an src/utils.py unless you have something in it.
- Keep the Tableau dashboard file separate from the data. It can be in an `/analysis` or `/visualization` folder instead.
- Already wrote you this in messages, but please stop using your names in your Jupyter notebooks. You're big data analysts now, please use the `notebook_no-analyst_initials-notebook_name.ipynb` convention, e.g.
`01-sgf-data-exploration.ipynb`, `03-sgf-client-behaviour-analysis.ipynb`, etc.
